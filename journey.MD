## My Life Journey

I am Arghyadeep Majumder, graduated as an Engineer in Electrical Engineering. I discovered my love for programming in the 2nd year of my college. Initially, I started with YouTube, Medium, Stack-overflow, and Google to get an understanding of programming. Later, I did many small freelancing projects, led the development team of the college fest. Fortunately, after hustling for a year, I got a break into the software industry. Then onwards its a journey of deep-sea development and husting.
